# Below we will define an n-interesting polygon. Your task is to find the area of a polygon for a given n. A 1-interesting polygon is just a square with a side of length 1. An n-interesting polygon is obtained by taking the n - 1-interesting polygon and appending 1-interesting polygons to its rim, side by side.

def solution(n):
    area = 1
    for i in range(n):
        area += i*4
    return area
